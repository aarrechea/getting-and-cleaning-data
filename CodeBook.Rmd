## Getting and Cleaning Data - Final project

### Variables:

x_test_train: the final tidy dataset of the point 4.
x: the dataset of the point 5.
x_test_table, x_train_table: the main original tables
y_test_table, y_train_table: tables with the total activities by activities ID
features, activity, and subjects tables, as indicated in their names.

### Processes

Instead merge the test and training data in the first place, I work first in each dataset separately, and finally, merged the two datasets.

1) First, I changed the columns names using the features table.
2) I added the activities IDs in an aditional column
3) I added the activities names, using a left join of the function merge
4) I added the subjects
5) I merged both datasets, test and train
6) Calculated the point five of the requirements.

In total I added three columns to the original dataset. I run the same process for both, train and test datasets.
Finally, I merged two datasets.

In order to fulfill the requirements of the project, I extracted the variables than I needed to calculate the las question.
So, I extracted the variables related with the mean, std, activities, and subjects. After that, grouped the dataset and aplied
the mean inside a summarize function.
