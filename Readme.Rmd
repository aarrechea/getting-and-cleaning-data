## Getting and Cleaning Data - Final project

### Explanation of the process

I separated the script in six parts:

- In the first part of the script, I loaded all the data sets I needed into R.
- In the second I added the variables names and combined (cbind) measurements, subjects and activities ids.
- In the third part, I used the left join of the merge function to add the names of the activities.
- In the fourth part, I combined the two datasets, train and test.
- In the fifth part, I extracted the variables related with the mean and std, also the activities and subjects.
- In the last part, I calculated the mean after grouping.

I chose to merge the train and test datasets when both datasets were completed with their correspondent variables names and additional columns, instead merge it at the beginning.

In total I added three columns to the original dataset. I run the same process for both, train and test datasets.
Finally, I merged two datasets.
